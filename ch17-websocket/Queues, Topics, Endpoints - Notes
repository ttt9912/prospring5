Queues, Topics, Endpoints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three main ways to say where messages are sent and how they are
subscribed to using Spring WebSockets and STOMP:

- Topics – common conversations or chat topics open to any client or user (p4)
- Queues – reserved for specific users and their current sessions         (p5)
- Endpoints – generic endpoints

Send to a single client: queue
Send to all clients: topic
