amqp entities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Exchanges: are like post offices or mailboxes and clients always
             publish a message to an AMQP exchange

- Queues: bind to exchange using the binding key. A binding is “link”
          that you set up to bind a queue to an exchange

- Messages: are sent to message broker/exchange with a routing key.

Exchange Types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exchanges are AMQP entities where messages are sent. Exchanges take a message
and route it into zero or more queues. There are four built in exchange types:

- Direct Exchange
- Fanout Exchange
- Topic Exchange
- Headers Exchange
