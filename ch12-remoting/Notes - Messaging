--- Messaging ---
Messaging relies on asynchronous message-passing instead of synchronous
request response-based architecture.
Producer and consumer of messages are decoupled by an intermediate
messaging layer known as the message broker.

--- JMS vs. AMQP ---
JMS commonly used for sending and receiving messages.
For interoperability between different vendors and platforms,
we wonâ€™t be able to use JMS clients and brokers.
This is where AMQP comes in handy.
