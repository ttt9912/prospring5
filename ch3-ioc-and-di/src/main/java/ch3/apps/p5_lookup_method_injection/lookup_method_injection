Working with beans of different life cycle.

Ziel: Pass a new instance in a method, every time it is invoked.

When a bean depends on another bean with a different lifecycle,
e.g. a singleton depends on a non-singleton, both setter and
constructor injection result in the singleton maintaining a
single instance of what should be a non-singleton.

Singleton      has a method parameter of                Nonsingleton
Bean      ------------------------------------------>   Bean

 - setter injection: same instance is passed every time
 - lookup method injection: new instance is passed every time

Should be used rarely. If you don't care, if three Singletons
are getting the same instance, then use standard DI (setter injection)


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Code
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Singer = Nonsingleton Bean
 - StandardLookupDemoBean: uses the stored Singer instance
 - AbstractLookupDemoBean: (abstract class) abstract getMySinger()
   is called by doSomething() to obtain a Singer instance
